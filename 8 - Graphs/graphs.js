//!   Graphs
              nodes are connected in any way/style - a network of nodes 
              example is in graphs.png 
              nodes are connected thru edges 
              
              
/// Types of graphs 
                    directional -> one way
                    undirectional -> two way -- no one sided arrows
                    weighted graphs -> they could carry data on their edges too
                    unweighted -> no data on edges 
                    cyclic -> network in a circular form 
                    acyclic -> no circular form

///- vertex is a  node, edge is connection btw 2 nodes
