//! What are stacks ???
//  stacks are high level data structure

// stacks are like
// plates are on the top of each other on a table
// the only plate, we can use, is the top one

// LIFO - Last In First Out
// the only plate we can out first, is the top last one added

// plate means data

// we can apply some specific operations only -- in stacks
// that means we can limit the operations, engineers can apply on this data structure

// pop()    -- O(1) -- removing last item
// push()   -- O(1) -- adding last item
// peek()   -- O(1) -- veiwing last item
// lookup() -- O(n) -- lookup will take O(n) and that's obvious, why

//! What are Queues ?

// Queues example is like
// 3 computers are connected to one printer and printer will print for only computer that will press "print" first

// FIFO -- First In First Out
// opposite of stacks

// we can apply specific operations on the very 1st item only
// like 1st element of array ,

// enqueue() -- O(1) -- adding item on the first
// dequeue() -- O(1) -- removing very 1st item
// peek()    -- O(1) -- viewing very 1st item
// lookup() -- O(n)
